## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#89B4FA) for a calm, reassuring feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), to provide good contrast.
- Accent color: Green (#A7F3D0) to indicate a positive 'mask detected' state.

- Use simple, clear icons for settings and status indicators.
- Subtle transitions for status updates and visual confirmations.
